# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2016
Set up 100 Days of Coding Challenge repo and joined Gitter chatroom.  Excited!

### Day 1: January 2, 2016
Set up a local SlackBot and using Algorithmia API to generate user sentiment, following http://blog.algorithmia.com/sentiment-analysis-slack-chatbot-python/ for initial setup

### Day 2: January 3, 2016
Toyed with sample version of SlackBot w/ Algorithmia API.  Realized it wasn't working, hacked out a working solution using the standard plugin implementation that slackhq recommends.  Might be a better way - learned some debugging w/ Python!
